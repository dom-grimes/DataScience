<h1>Dominique's Data Science Portfolio</h1>

<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hi there, It’s nice to meet you! My name is Dominique Grimes, but many affectionately refer to me as Dom.<p> 

<p>Let’s pause for a quick story.<br>
<blockquote>
            <dt>I am four years old in pre-school learning to write my name.</dt>
            <dt>I write:  D-O-M-I-N-I-Q-U-E</dt>
            <dt>I think to myself, <i>This takes way too long.</i></dt>
            <dt>A few days later...</dt>
            <dt>My teacher reads a random name at the top of a paper.</dt>
            <dt>She asks the class, "Who's Amy?"</dt>
            <dt>I confidently raise my hand and answer, "That's me!"</dt>
            <dt>I had made the executive decision to shorten my name from nine letters to three.</dt>
</blockquote><p>

<p>All of that to say, since the young age of four I've had a passion for efficiency.<br>
My mind is wired for optimization and figuring out ways to bring the pieces together harmoniously. It brings me joy!<br>
That doesn't just include the "mechanics" of something. <br>
It's the entire process: building relationships, communication strategies, client experience, adding value and impact, balancing expense.</p>

</p>Throughout my career I’ve found myself in various roles, constantly exposing myself to learning and adding value in new ways.<br>
What started as Policy Processor/Backup Receptionist at an independent insurance broker, led to...<br>
      Account Manager &#8594; Area Manager &#8594; Corporate Client Service Excellence Program Coordinator &#8594; State Client Service Leader &#8594; VP, Quality Assurance &#8594; VP, Product Manager of Client Service Management Systems<br>
      A few years ago, an opportunity crossed my path to pursue my master’s in data science, and here I am!<br>
      I’d like to share my Data Science journey with you.</p> 

</p>If you're familiar with Clifton StrengthsFinder’s, here are my top five themed strengths:
      <ol>
        <li>Learner - Loves learning for the sake of learning.</li>
        <li>Achiever - Always up for a challenge. Cue grit!</li>
        <li>Significance - Fulfilled by contributing to things that make a difference.</li>
        <li>Restorative - Bring life back to lost hope. I visualize how to fix things others may miss.</li>
        <li>Analytical - Dig deeper into my portfolio to find out for yourself!</li>
      </ol>
