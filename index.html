Hi there! Nice to meet you. My name is Dominique Grimes, but I am often affectionately referred to as Dom. 

Pause for a quick story here: 
      I am four years old in pre-school learning to write my name.
      I write:  D-O-M-I-N-I-Q-U-E
      I think to myself, _This takes way too long._
      A few days later... The teacher says, "Who's Amy?"
      I raise my hand and say, "That's me! I changed my name to Amy."

All of that to say, since the young age of four I've had a passion for efficiency. 
My mind is wired for optimization and figuring out ways to bring the pieces together harmoniously. It brings me joy!
That doesn't just include the "mechanics" of something. 
It's the entire process: building relationships, communication strategies, client experience, adding value and impact, balancing expense.

If you're familiar with Clifton Strengthfinders, here are my top five themed strengths:
      1. Learner - Loves learning for the sake of learning.
      2. Achiever - Always up for a challenge. Cue grit!
      3. Significance - Fulfilled by contributing to things that make a difference.
      4. Restorative - Bring life back to lost hope. I visualize how to fix things others may miss. 
      5. Analytical - Dig deeper into my portfolio to find out for yourself!
