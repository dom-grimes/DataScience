<h1>Dominique's Data Science Portfolio</h1>
<p>Hi there, It’s nice to meet you! My name is Dominique Grimes, but many affectionately refer to me as Dom.<p> 

<p>Let’s pause for a quick story.\n
      I am four years old in pre-school learning to write my name.\n
      I write:  D-O-M-I-N-I-Q-U-E\n
      I think to myself, _This takes way too long._\n
      A few days later... \n
      My teacher reads a random name at the top of a paper and asks the class, \n
      "Who's Amy?"\n
      I raise my hand and say, "That's me! I changed my name to Amy.”<p>

<p>All of that to say, since the young age of four I've had a passion for efficiency.\n
My mind is wired for optimization and figuring out ways to bring the pieces together harmoniously. It brings me joy!\n
That doesn't just include the "mechanics" of something. \n
It's the entire process: building relationships, communication strategies, client experience, adding value and impact, balancing expense.</p>

</p>Throughout my career I’ve found myself in various roles, constantly exposing myself to learning and adding value in new ways. \n
What started as Policy Processor/Backup Receptionist at an independent insurance broker, led to 
      Account Manager --> Area Manager --> Corporate Client Service Excellence Program Coordinator --> State Client Service leader --> VP of Quality Assurance --> VP, Product Manager of Client Service Management Systems\n
      A few years ago, an opportunity crossed my path to pursue my master’s in data science, and here I am! I’d like to share my Data Science journey with you.</p> 

</p>If you're familiar with Clifton StrengthsFinder’s, here are my top five themed strengths:
      1. Learner - Loves learning for the sake of learning.
      2. Achiever - Always up for a challenge. Cue grit!
      3. Significance - Fulfilled by contributing to things that make a difference.
      4. Restorative - Bring life back to lost hope. I visualize how to fix things others may miss. 
      5. Analytical - Dig deeper into my portfolio to find out for yourself!
